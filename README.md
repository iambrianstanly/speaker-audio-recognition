# Speaker Audio Recognition

## Overview

This project focuses on building a deep learning model for speaker audio recognition. The model takes audio samples as input and accurately identifies the speaker by outputting their name.

## Features

- **Speaker Identification:** Recognizes individual speakers from audio samples.
- **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes a deep learning architecture tailored for audio processing.
- **Training and Testing:** The model was trained on a dataset of various speakers and tested for accuracy.
